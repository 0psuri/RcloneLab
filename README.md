## Introduction

**RcloneLab** is a rclone GUI for Google Colaboratory, similar to Rclone Browser. Please consider contributing our project, any improved version of the code is welcome and much appreciate.

[**Rclone**](https://rclone.org/) ("rsync for cloud storage") is a command line program to sync files and directories to and from different cloud storage providers.

[**Google Colaboratory**](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud.

## Installation

1. Open the IPython Notebook file in Google Colaboratory by clicking [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/MinorMole/RcloneLab/blob/master/RcloneLab.ipynb).
2. Click "Run cell" (play button) in the Installation section. Time Zone setup is optional for the correct time of log output.
